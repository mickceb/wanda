## A smaller React project bundling with Parcel.js

Create React App is a easiest way to start a new React Project, but it sure does install a loads of stuff. Many. Too many.

Wanda is a starter kit bundle with [Parcel.js](https://fr.parceljs.org/), the Blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler. I've created it because I was tired of waiting for webpack. In comparaison, Parcel takes a little tens of seconds to bundle the files.

### First :
```
git clone https://github.com/mickceb/wanda.git
```
### Then :
```
npm start
```

### To change the git repo :
```
git remote set-url origin [git@your.git.repo.example.com/user/repo.git]
```
