## A smaller React project bundling with Parcel.js

Create React App is a easiest way to start a new React Project, but it sure does install a loads of stuff. Many. Too many.

Wanda is a starter kit bundle with (Parcel.js)[https://fr.parceljs.org/], the Blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler. I've created it because I was tired of waiting for webpack. In comparaison, Parcel takes a little tens of seconds to bundle the files.

```
npm start
```
